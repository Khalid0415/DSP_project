This project is part of the Data Science Programming course
and focuses on applying various programming techniques to a dataset using Python.

Key components include:
	•	Data analysis with Pandas
	•	Data preprocessing such as cleaning and transformation
	•	Handling JSON files for structured data extraction
	•	Using multi-processing to improve performance on heavy tasks
	•	Implementing web crawling to automatically collect data from the web

The goal is to integrate multiple data processing techniques
to perform efficient and effective analysis.
